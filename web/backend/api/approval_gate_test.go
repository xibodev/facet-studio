// your approval before it runs", and nothing enforced it.

// The Approved flag chose whether a consent claim was STRIPPED or RECORDED --
// which is a different question. An unapproved invocation of a cost_known:false
// capability ran and produced an artefact. Reproduced against the running host:
// POST /api/modules/midden/invoke with content.produce and no approval returned
// ok:true with one artifact.
//
// The Modules page already computed needs_approval and showed it to the
// operator. It was advice, not a gate.
