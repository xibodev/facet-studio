// WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A NOTE. The edge this guards against already
// existed once, and nothing failed when it did: adding one import to
// internal/moduletools -- a package the shell legitimately uses to LIST and
// INSTALL modules -- pulled pkg/agent and six other packages into a binary that
// never runs an agent. Every test stayed green, both binaries built, and the
// product behaved identically. The only observable was the dependency graph.
//
// That is the shape this codebase keeps finding: two states, one observable. A
// shell that links the kernel and a shell that does not are indistinguishable
// from the outside, so the check has to look at the thing that actually differs.
//
// The split is what makes the kernel shippable on its own. If the shell links
// the kernel, "distribute them separately" is a packaging claim with nothing
// underneath it.
