# Hash the WIRE SHAPE of the v2 proposal, excluding the review appendix.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Twice I published a number about this document that a sibling
# lane re-measured and got something different -- first the freeze diff (91/1 vs
# their 130/8), then "the wire shape is byte-identical" (actually 82 insertions,
# 6 deletions). Both times the CONCLUSION was sound and the arithmetic described
# a narrower thing than the sentence claimed: I was describing the subset I
# changed deliberately and stating it as a property of the whole file.
#
# A reader re-running a whole-file diff cannot tell my imprecision from a clause
# moving underneath them -- which is the doubt the evidence exists to remove. So
# the scope is EXECUTABLE rather than described in prose.
#
# The boundary is the review appendix heading. Everything above it is the shape a
# lane reviews; everything below is the record of who reviewed what. A review
# carries across a revision iff this hash is unchanged.
#
# THE BOUNDARY IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED -- and the first version of this script
# did assume it. Midden ran it and found that 0e58c7c predates the appendix
# entirely, so the awk never matched, never exited, and hashed the WHOLE FILE.
# The published 22a6f6af2fd557d8 was a whole-document hash sitting in a column
# labelled "wire shape".
#
# A missing boundary and a matched boundary produced THE SAME OBSERVABLE: a
# 16-char hex string with nothing saying which scope it covered. The tool built
# to remove that exact doubt reproduced it one level in, silently, for one row.
#
# So a revision without the boundary is now a LOUD REFUSAL rather than a
# plausible number. This is RFC v2 section 9's own layer-2 rule -- confirm the
# mutation landed before trusting the result -- applied to a scope marker
# instead of a mutant. A scoped check needs its scope validated, or it is
# evidence about something it does not name.
# EXIT CODES -- and why a distinct one is worth having.
#
#   0  a scoped hash was computed
#   2  CANNOT READ the document at that revision (bad ref, missing file)
#   3  SCOPE REFUSED: the boundary is absent or ambiguous at that revision
#
# 3 rather than 1 so a caller can branch on "this revision has no wire-shape
# hash" versus "the script itself failed" (bad ref, missing file, not a repo).
# Those need different responses: the first is a fact about the revision, the
# second is a broken invocation.
#
# Midden measured 1 on every path after I documented 3. hash_at returned 3 and
# BOTH CALLERS FLATTENED IT -- `exit 1` on the no-args path, a hardcoded
# `status=1` on the multi-arg path. The value was right inside the function and
# wrong at the boundary the caller reads, so the doc promised a signal the
# script could not send. A distinct code is only worth documenting if a caller
# can branch on it. Fixed by propagating this constant, which is now the single
# source so the two cannot drift again.
