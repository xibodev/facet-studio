// policy says what the host will actually allow, and the grant is the
// intersection. Neither side alone decides -- a module cannot widen its own
// authority by declaring more, and the host cannot confer authority for
// something the module never declared and therefore cannot be expecting.
//
// The zero value authorizes nothing, which is the correct default for a host
// that has not made a decision yet.

	// PATHS. A module reads the grant to decide whether it MAY shell out, and
	// the path to know what to run -- so filling only Binaries left a module
	// with a path it was not authorized to use. Midden's evidence.extract
	// refused with "no AI CLI was granted for this invocation" one line after
	// the host printed "binaries: 3/3 resolved"; both were true, about

// first the host GRANTS, and the host cannot tell a signed-in CLI from a merely
// installed one -- `copilot --version` exits 0 on a machine where every real
// request fails to authenticate. Narrowing the grant is the one lever the host
// legitimately has: it is a statement about what this machine authorizes, not a
// guess about which CLI works.
//

// it is the user saying which of their CLIs they are actually signed in to.

// nil is the important case: intersect() treats a nil policy list under

// nothing" -- a stray export should not silently disable every module's
// subprocess access with no error anywhere.

// ApplyGrants fills req.Grants from what the module DECLARED, intersected with
// what the host policy authorizes.
//
// This is the per-invocation half of "installing a module grants nothing".
// Authority is conferred here, on this call, and only for names the module
// declared up front -- the same rule GrantBinaries applies to executables.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing:
//
//   - A grant is not consent. Authorizing a paid provider says the host will
//     let the module reach it; whether to spend money on this particular call
//     is a separate human decision the module still has to ask for. Collapsing
//     the two is how an unpriced call gets made because someone once ticked a
//     box.
//   - An empty grant list means "nothing authorized", and that is different
//     from a module being invoked outside any host mediation. A module that
//     receives an explicit empty list must fail closed rather than assume it
//     was called directly.
//
// Subprocess IS set here, and the comment that used to say otherwise was wrong
// in a way that cost a journey. The reasoning -- that req.Binaries carries the
// resolved paths, so naming them again would be a second source of truth --
// sounded right and left Grants.Subprocess permanently empty. A module reads
// the GRANT to decide whether it may shell out and the PATH to know what to
// run; supplying only the path handed it an executable with no permission to
// use it, and Midden refused with "no AI CLI was granted" one line after the
// host printed "binaries: 3/3 resolved".
//
// The two are not duplicates: one is authority, the other is location.
