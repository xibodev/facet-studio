// ResolveBinaries turns a module's DECLARED subprocess names into absolute
// paths for one invocation.
//
// Modules run with no inherited environment, so there is no PATH for them to
// search. The host resolves on their behalf, which is deliberately stronger
// than handing over a minimal PATH: a search can resolve to something that was
// never declared -- a shadowing entry, or a second binary with the same name in
// a supplied directory -- whereas an absolute path is an identity rather than a
// query. It also makes Permissions.Subprocess load-bearing: a binary the module
// did not declare is never supplied, so it cannot be run.
//
// Only names in `declared` are ever looked up. A name absent from the
// descriptor is not resolvable by asking, which is what keeps the capability
// list and the execution authority in agreement.
//
// A declared binary that cannot be resolved is OMITTED rather than mapped to an
// empty string, so "not supplied" and "supplied as nothing" stay
// distinguishable -- the same rule that keeps unknown cost from becoming zero.
// The unresolved names are returned so the host can tell the user which
// requirement is unmet instead of letting the module fail opaquely.
