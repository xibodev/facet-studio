// The environment guarantee, proven against a REAL SPAWNED PROCESS rather than
// against the helper that builds the list.
//
// tempOnlyEnv() has good tests, but they assert what the function RETURNS. The
// guarantee the README makes is about what a module can SEE, and those are only
// the same while cmd.Env is assigned exactly once and never appended to. A
// single `cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(), ...)` anywhere would satisfy every
// existing test and leak the host's entire environment.
//
// This matters concretely: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set on the machine this was
// developed on, and a module that inherited it could reach a paid provider
// without ever being granted that credential.
