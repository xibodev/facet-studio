// across the CLI, the agent and the cockpit, and every one that diverged
// produced a bug. The two approval gates had not diverged yet -- they both
// called MayBillUnder and then each rebuilt "and nobody approved" separately.
// Sharing it is what keeps a later fix from landing on one caller only.
