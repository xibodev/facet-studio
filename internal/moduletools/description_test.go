// The bug this exists for: the description said a paid capability "requires

// tool, it reasoned about filling in approved_by and paid_generation_approved.
//
// It cannot. The host strips approval claims arriving through the agent, so a
// consent the model constructs is discarded however the user phrases their
// permission. This is what the model reads while DECIDING -- the failure
// message only arrives after it has already promised the user a result.
