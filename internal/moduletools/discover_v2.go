// V2 is a discovered module's v2 standing: which contract governs it, and
// whether it conforms.
//
// Present on every Installed, including v1 modules and refusals, because the
// alternative -- a nil field meaning "v1, probably" -- makes three outcomes
// share one observable. A caller must be able to tell "no v2 declaration" from
// "declared something this host refuses" from "not evaluated at all".

	// when the pin returned v2. There is nothing to check on a v1 module: its

// BOTH conditions, and the conjunction is the point. Passing the pin means the
// module claims v2; conforming means its projection does not weaken what it
// claims. A module that passes the pin and fails conformance is MORE dangerous
// than a v1 module, not less: it has been admitted to the v2 path where the
// gate reads capability effects, while declaring capability effects weaker than
// its own Operations.

// `result` field holds the descriptor, so contract_version sits NESTED. Passing
// raw stdout to Evaluate returns v1 for EVERY module -- silently, because a
// missing contract_version is a legitimate answer meaning "this is a v1
// module". The wrong input and a correct v1 module produce the same outcome.
//
// The sibling lane hit this on their first probe against this gate and reported
// it: they nearly concluded "no problem, we interoperate" from a v1 result that
// was an artifact of their test input. Pinned by test so a future caller cannot

// remedies, and collapsing them would send an author to fix the wrong thing --
// the failure mode the reason/remedy split exists to prevent.
