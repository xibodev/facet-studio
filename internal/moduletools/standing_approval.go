// EnvApproveCapabilities names capabilities the operator has already decided
// about, as a comma-separated list of "<module>/<capability>".
//
// It exists because enforcing the approval guarantee made the operator's actual
// goal impossible. "Create a video from simple chatting" goes through a
// cost_known:false capability every time; the agent cannot approve, because an
// approval arriving through the model is stripped by design; and approval is
// per-call and remembered nowhere. So chat could never complete that journey
// again -- the control was correct and the product stopped working.
//
// This is the operator saying, once and explicitly, "I have read what this
// capability declares and I accept it". It is not the host inferring anything,
// and it is not the model deciding: a standing approval can only be set by
// someone with access to the environment the host runs in.
//
// Deliberately NOT a wildcard. "Approve everything this module ever adds" is
// not a decision anyone can make in advance -- the module updates and the
// approval silently covers capabilities that did not exist when it was
// written. Each entry names one capability.
