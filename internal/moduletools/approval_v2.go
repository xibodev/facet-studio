// "possibly-billing", so a free-but-irreversible step was ungated entirely and
// a cost-checking tool was gated as though it spent money. v2 carries the
// REASON (section 6), and the reason is what a person is actually being asked

//
// THE INPUT MATTERS, AND THAT IS THE POINT. v1's gate read a static boolean, so
// a capability that charges for 12 of 19 kinds was gated for all 19 --
// permanently over-gating the 7 free ones. Section 2a rule 2 evaluates the
// capability's condition against the actual request, so the free kinds stop
// being gated at the layer that acts.
//
// IT READS CAPABILITY EFFECTS, NOT OPERATION EFFECTS (section 2). The Operation
// is where the semantics live; the capability is where the gate reads. That
// ordering is why the no-weakening check exists at all: a capability weaker
// than its Operation would disable this gate while the Operation still read
// correct to a reviewer. So this function assumes conformance has already run,
// and the caller is responsible for that -- see HostConformance.
//
// A capability projecting NO Operation is still gated. A registry read
// transforms no product material and is still invocable, so its declared
// effects are still the thing the host acts on.
