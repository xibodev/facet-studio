// Package moduletools adapts detached module capabilities into agent tools.

// This is the seam the whole architecture exists for. A module declares
// capabilities; the host turns each enabled one into a tool the agent can call,
// so "assay my last three Claude sessions" reaches sessions.assay without the
// agent knowing anything about Midden, and without Midden being linked into
// this binary.
//
// The host stays in charge of everything that matters. It decides which
// capabilities become tools, supplies filesystem roots and subprocess binaries
// per invocation, enforces bounds, and validates what comes back. A module
// contributes a description and a schema; it does not gain authority by being
// installed.
