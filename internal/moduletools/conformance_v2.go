// WHY A TYPE RATHER THAN AN ERROR. A conformance run produces per-target
// findings, and the operator ruling is that conformance is evaluated PER TARGET
// independently: a projection may not claim conformance while silently
// weakening a mandatory requirement, and one module's failure says nothing
// about another's. An error return would collapse that into a single boolean
// at the call site.

// being reviewed: the Operation reads correct while the gate, which reads
// capability effects, fires on nothing. So the check runs here, before any
// capability of this module reaches NeedsApprovalV2.
//
// It takes an Accepted rather than a *Descriptor, which is not a stylistic
// choice: an Accepted can only be produced by modprotov2.Evaluate, so the
// contract pin has necessarily already run. The ordering the operator requires
// -- gate before reliance -- is therefore enforced by the type system rather
// than by this comment.
