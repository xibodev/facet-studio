// The bug this exists for: the approval gate I shipped an hour ago broke
// journey B.
//
// Facet declares creative.tools.estimate as cost_known:false while ALSO
// declaring local=true, network=false, provider="local". Those cannot all be
// true: a capability that reaches no network and no provider has nothing to
// bill through. Its own summary says "never bills", and the host already
// warned about the contradiction.
//
// So the gate refused a free, local capability, and an operator asking for a
// video in chat was told to go and approve a cost-estimation tool. Correct by
// the letter of the declaration, and wrong.
//
// The host now decides on STRUCTURE rather than prose. Prose is not a contract
// -- "never bills" is a sentence -- but local && !network && provider in
// {"", "local"} is the module's own machine-readable statement that nothing
// leaves the box.
// An unknown cost gates, whatever else the capability declares.
//
// Two structural rules were tried and both failed. Treating local &&
// !network as free let Midden's content.produce through ungated -- it spends
// by shelling out to an AI CLI, which the module's own effects never mention.
// Adding "the module declares subprocess binaries" re-gated that and also
// gated Facet's creative.tools.estimate, because Facet declares ffmpeg and
// ffprobe, neither of which can charge anything.
//
// The cost of guessing wrong is asymmetric, and that decides it: a wrongly
// gated free capability is an extra click; a wrongly ungated paid one spends
// the user's money without asking.
