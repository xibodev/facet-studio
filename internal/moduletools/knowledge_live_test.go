// TestLoadKnowledgeAgainstRealModules exercises composition against whatever
// modules are actually installed, and skips when none are. It is the check that
// a declared overlay is genuinely readable and genuinely matches its digest --
// which a synthetic fixture cannot tell you, because the fixture author
// controls both sides.
//
// IT HAD NO ASSERTIONS AT ALL, AND THAT IS WORSE THAN IT SOUNDS. Every outcome
// printed and passed: a module declaring five overlays and loading zero read
// exactly like one that loaded all five. The comment above claims this is "the
// check that a declared overlay is genuinely readable and genuinely matches its
// digest" -- and it checked nothing. A digest mismatch REFUSES content silently
// by design (see staleContentWarnings), so the failure this test exists to
// catch is invisible precisely when it happens.
//
// Found by running a sibling lane's audit method against my own tree after I
// made the same mistake in a different test and they found the same class in
// theirs. Their finding: grouping by file or by function finds nothing, because
// the file has assertions and the function has assertions -- you have to read
// what each log actually REPORTS. Mine did not even need that: the function has
// zero assertions and my pass-1 grep still missed it, because it greps for
// t.Error and this package's other tests use it while this function does not.
