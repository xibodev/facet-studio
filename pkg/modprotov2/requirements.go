//
// v1 could not say this at all: Requirement had no strength field, so a host
// could not tell a missing dependency that blocks an Operation from one that
// degrades it. Midden's d2 is preferred (diagrams render without it, worse);
// an API key is mandatory.

// State is a Resolution outcome. THREE states, never a bool (§5).

// v1 had Requirement.Available bool -- two states for a three-state world. The
// missing one is UNKNOWN, and it is not a technicality: a credential that is
// present but never exercised is neither satisfied nor unsatisfied, and
// reporting it as either is a lie in a different direction. Facet has two
// providers in exactly this state.
//
// `disabled` is NOT a Resolution state. It is USER INTENT ("do not use this
// even though it works"), and all three states here are statements about
// whether the thing WORKS. A lane with a four-state model would flatten
// disabled into unsatisfied and report a working provider as broken; Midden
// proposed keeping enablement product-side rather than widening the contract,
// and that is the right call.
