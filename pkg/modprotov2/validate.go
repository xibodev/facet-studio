// suggests is the defect this contract keeps finding. This checks declarations
// against each other. It does NOT open artifact files, run validators, or
// probe requirements -- those need a real invocation and live in the
// conformance suite that runs against a binary.

// validateShape reports a descriptor that declares v2 and then declares no v2

//
// REPORTED, NOT REFUSED, and the distinction took checking rather than
// instinct. A capability projecting NO Operation is explicitly legal -- a
// registry read transforms no product material -- so a module whose every
// capability is a registry read legitimately has zero Operations. Refusing that
// outright would reject a shape the frozen contract permits, which is a
// contract change wearing an implementation's clothes.
//
// What IS worth saying is that two very different states currently look
// identical: a module with genuinely no Operations, and a module whose v2
// payload is not built yet. A sibling lane reported exactly this against their
// own binary -- they publish contract_version with no operations because their
// projection work is held -- and correctly said the call was mine, not theirs.
//
// So the host says which one it is looking at and lets a person decide.
//
// AND IT SAYS PLAINLY THAT IT CANNOT DECIDE, which took a second correction to
// get right. My first version of this split claimed the host could classify the
// sibling's build from the descriptor alone. It cannot: the half-published
// discriminator fires only when artifact_kinds are PRESENT, and a lane that has
// not started migrating has neither Operations nor kinds. So the discriminator
// is unreachable for exactly the mid-migration population it was built to
// classify -- measured against their real binary, which publishes 21 v1
// artifact_schemas and zero v2 artifact_kinds.
//
// Nothing else on the wire decides it either: a capability declaring
// `projects: []` because it dispatches would differ from one declaring it as a
// registry read, but a pre-migration module declares `projects` at all. The
// case is genuinely undecidable until a module starts migrating, and a finding
// that says so is worth more than a signal invented to make it decidable.
