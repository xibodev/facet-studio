// Schema and validated none of them. That is wrong in two directions at once:
// nothing was enforced, and an mp4 was undeclarable without implying a
// validator that cannot exist. Facet raised the second; it is what created §7.

// passes that; the intent fails. So conformance must check WHAT the validator
// validates, and the two failures are distinct: a validator that does not
