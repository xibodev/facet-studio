// Accepted is a descriptor whose contract pin PASSED. It is the only way to
// obtain v2 semantics from this package.
//
// THE ORDERING IS STRUCTURAL, NOT DOCUMENTED. The operator's requirement is
// that the contract gate execute before the host relies on any v2 semantic
// declaration. A comment saying "call CheckPin first" is exactly the kind of
// prose guarantee this contract exists to stop shipping: it holds until someone
// adds a call site that does not read it.
//
// So the v2 descriptor is unexported inside this type and reachable only
// through a constructor that runs the pin. A caller CANNOT hold v2 Operations
// without having passed the gate, because there is no other way to build one.

// outcome is what the host CONCLUDES. A transmitted "state" field would let a
// module assert its own evaluation, which is the thing the evaluation exists to
