// Package modprotov2 is the wire representation of the frozen
// xibodev.module/v2 behavioural contract.
//
// SEPARATE PACKAGE FROM modproto, DELIBERATELY. modproto is xibodev.module/v1:
// immutable legacy behaviour that nothing may be added to. A module speaks one
// wire or the other, never both, and putting v2 fields on v1 structs would be
// the "smuggling successor semantics into a v1 exchange" that final ruling 5
// forbids -- tolerant decoding is not permission.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS AND IS NOT. It carries the frozen shape
// (docs/architecture/WIRE_V2_PROPOSAL.md, wire shape 031a89d07f6dfd12) and the mechanical
// checks the contract requires. It does NOT decide policy: whether a host gates
// on a given effect, how it renders an artifact, or what it does with a
// refusal, all live above this package. The contract says what may be said;
// the host says what to do about it.
//
// EVERY FIELD TRACES TO A FROZEN CLAUSE. The proposal's own rule is that
// anything not traceable to a specific v1 gap should be cut, and it was applied
// against this author: `long_running` was in the draft, appeared zero times in
// the frozen RFC, and is cut (§1b). It remains in v1 on
// modproto.Capability.LongRunning, which is untouched.

// TWO LAYERS, AND THE PROJECTION IS NOT 1:1 IN EITHER DIRECTION (§2).

// registry read transforms no product material and is still invocable, so it
// still declares effects.
