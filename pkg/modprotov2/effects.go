	// genuinely independent: one of Facet's tools declares cost_known TRUE and
	// network TRUE and requires no consent, and Midden's estimate capability --
	// whose entire purpose is checking cost BEFORE a paid run -- declared
	// cost_known false while its own summary said it never bills. Gating the
	// cost-checking tool as possibly-billing discourages the one behaviour that
	// makes a cost gate work.

// would force 19 Operations onto the wire -- a delivery detail becoming
// product semantics, which final ruling 10 forbids -- or permanently over-gate
// 7 free kinds.
//
// AND WHY IT IS LEGAL AT THE CAPABILITY LAYER TOO (§2a). The first draft put
// the conditional on the Operation and a collapsed boolean on the capability.
// For kind=retrieval_pack that yields TWO DECLARED ANSWERS FOR ONE INVOCATION:
// the Operation evaluates false, the capability reads true, and the measured
// truth is false. Worse, since the gate reads capability effects, §3a became
// expressible where nothing reads it and unreachable where something does.
