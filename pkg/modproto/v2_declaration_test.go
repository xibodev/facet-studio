// A descriptor declaring contract_version MUST still decode and validate on the
// v1 path, and MUST NOT thereby gain any v2 guarantee.
//
// UNTESTED UNTIL NOW, AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE NOTICED. The sibling lane has built
// a bundle that publishes contract_version: xibodev.module/v2. Today that field
// is unknown to v1 and silently ignored, which is exactly what RFC section 10
// requires -- absent or unrecognised v2 fields fall back to v1 behaviour, never
// to a more permissive default.
//
// But "works because the decoder happens to be tolerant" and "works because the
// contract requires it" produce THE SAME OBSERVABLE today. If DecodeEnvelope or
// ValidateDescriptor ever gained DisallowUnknownFields -- a reasonable-looking
// hardening -- every v2-declaring module would break on the v1 path with
// nothing anywhere saying why. This pins the direction so that change fails
// here instead.

	// "protocol" rather than "contract_version" until it was removed, meaning
	// the test proved tolerance in general while claiming to prove it for the
	// one field that matters. An assertion that fires for the wrong reason is
	// the same false green as one that never fires.

// THIS IS §10's "v2 is ADDITIVE" MADE EXECUTABLE, and it is what settles how a

//
// Additive means a v2 descriptor is a v1 descriptor PLUS fields: ONE payload,
// valid under both validators. If v2 required a flag to appear, it would not be
// additive -- it would be a second document behind a second call, and §10's
// "v1 modules keep working" would be satisfied only by the module publishing
// two different things.
//
// So the handshake follows from the text rather than from preference: modules
// publish contract_version UNCONDITIONALLY, in the envelope, and the host sends
// no flag. That is what this host already does and what one sibling already
// does; the other made the alternative reading, which is honest against a

// validators against ONE payload finds it. A module can be perfectly conformant
