// Package modproto defines the Facet Studio detached-module protocol: the
// wire contract between the host and locally installed module executables.
//
// The host speaks exactly two verbs to a module binary:
//
//	<module-bin> module describe --json
//	<module-bin> module invoke <capability> --input <request.json>
//
// There is no legacy fallback shape and no per-module adapter branch. A module
// keeps whatever human-facing CLI it likes; the host never calls it.
//
// Wire rules (enforced by the host, not merely documented):
//
//   - stdout carries exactly one bounded JSON envelope and nothing else;
//   - stderr is advisory only: captured, bounded, surfaced as diagnostics,
//     and never parsed for control flow or protocol data;
//   - modules are detached local processes, never imported Go packages;
//   - every path is explicit, canonicalized, and confined to a declared root;
//   - unknown cost stays unknown; it never silently becomes zero;
//   - module output is untrusted input until the host validates it.
//
// # Empty collections
//
// Every slice and map field is emitted as [] or {} and never as null, so no
// reader has to distinguish "absent" from "empty". Go does not give this for
// free: json.Marshal renders a nil slice as null and a nil map as null.
//
// Order matters, and getting it wrong is silent. Envelope.Result is a
// json.RawMessage, so a payload is already opaque bytes by the time the
// envelope is normalized; normalizing only the envelope fixes Warnings and
// Artifacts while leaving the payload itself full of nulls. The payload must be
// normalized FIRST, then marshalled into Result, then the envelope normalized.
//
// Build responses with NewResultEnvelope, NewErrorEnvelope, or
// NewDescribeEnvelope, which do this in the right order. They exist so that
// correctness does not depend on remembering the order.
//
// # Digests
//
// Every digest field in this protocol is "sha256:" followed by lowercase hex.
// The algorithm prefix is mandatory so the protocol can adopt another hash
// without ambiguity. Use DigestSHA256 to format one.
