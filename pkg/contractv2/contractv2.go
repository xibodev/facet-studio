// Package contractv2 declares the identity of the frozen xibodev.module/v2
// behavioural Target Contract and the exact-pin check that gates it.
//
// SCOPE. This package answers exactly one question: may the host rely on v2
// behavioural guarantees when talking to this counterparty? It deliberately
// contains no other v2 semantics. Contract vocabulary and facility
// implementation are separate concerns (operator ruling), so nothing here
// implements approval, budgets, resume, or effects.
//
// NOT YET WIRED, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. CheckPin has no callers today,
// because the v1 descriptor has no contract_version field to read and v1 is
// immutable -- adding one would be smuggling successor semantics into a v1
// exchange, which the operator ruling forbids. The gate exists first so that
// nothing downstream is built assuming v2 guarantees before there is a check
// that they were agreed to.
//
// This repo has shipped the opposite shape twice, and both are recorded as
// defects: internal/view's schema-keyed views and Registry.SetEnabled are
// declared, documented, and have no callers. The difference is that those are
// unreachable BEHAVIOUR presented as available, while this is a gate waiting
// for a wire that does not exist yet. Stated explicitly so the next reader does
// not have to infer which kind it is -- an unwired thing that nobody labels
// looks identical to a forgotten one.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE PACKAGE FROM modproto. xibodev.module/v1 is immutable legacy
// behaviour: nothing may be added to it, and tolerant decoding is not
// permission to smuggle successor semantics into a v1 exchange. modproto's
// ProtocolID versions the WIRE FORMAT. This versions BEHAVIOUR, which v1 never
// versioned at all -- and conflating the two is what let two sibling lanes
// infer behavioural guarantees from what a wire validator happened to accept.
//
// PINNING, NOT NEGOTIATION. By operator ruling, v2 uses an exact pinned
// identity. Module and host each declare exactly one behavioural contract
// version; equal means proceed to conformance evaluation, anything else means
// refuse deterministically with a reason and a remedy.
//
// Explicitly excluded, and this is the load-bearing part: version ranges,
// highest-common-version selection, downgrade, fallback, and pseudo-
// negotiation. A single-element list that merely LOOKS negotiable is excluded
// too. That is not a stylistic preference -- v1 shipped exactly that shape, a
// doc comment promising the host "selects the highest it also supports" over a
// membership test against one frozen constant, and a sibling lane built a
// versioning story on the promise before discovering it was inert. A structure
// that can only ever hold one value should not be shaped like a choice.
//
// Real negotiation may be designed later, only when multiple behavioural
// contract versions actually coexist, a host intentionally supports more than
// one, and a real consumer needs runtime selection. Until then exact pinning is
// simpler and more truthful.

// module the moment this gate was wired -- breaking the frozen contract's own
// compatibility rule (§10: v1 modules keep working; absent v2 fields fall back
// to v1 behaviour, never to a more permissive default).
//
// The sibling lane found this from the other side: they permit an absent
// contract_version for exactly this reason and refuse present-and-wrong. Same
// conclusion, reached independently, and their message is what prompted the
// re-read that found the conflation here.

// behaviour, never to a more permissive default.
//
// An EXPLICIT "xibodev.module/v1" is refused rather than served, and the
// distinction is deliberate. That string is the WIRE-FORMAT identity
// (modproto.ProtocolID); it is not a behavioural contract, because v1 behaviour
// was never versioned -- which is the entire premise of having a successor.
// Serving it would put a name in the conformance record that names nothing: a
// consumer reading "governed by xibodev.module/v1" could not tell it from a
// real contract identity, and §10 forbids falling back to a more permissive
// default. A contract name that names no guarantees IS the more permissive
// default. The sibling lane reached the same conclusion independently and both
// pins produce the same four outcomes.
