// WriteFileAtomic atomically writes data to a file using a temp file + rename pattern.
//
// This guarantees that the target file is either:
// - Completely written with the new data
// - Unchanged (if any step fails before rename)
//
// The function:
// 1. Creates a temp file in the same directory (original untouched)
// 2. Writes data to temp file
// 3. Syncs data to disk (critical for SD cards/flash storage)
// 4. Sets file permissions
// 5. Syncs directory metadata (ensures rename is durable)
// 6. Atomically renames temp file to target path
//
// Safety guarantees:
// - Original file is NEVER modified until successful rename
// - Temp file is always cleaned up on error
// - Data is flushed to physical storage before rename
// - Directory entry is synced to prevent orphaned inodes
//
// Parameters:
//   - path: Target file path
//   - data: Data to write
//   - perm: File permission mode (e.g., 0o600 for secure, 0o644 for readable)
//
// Returns:
//   - Error if any step fails, nil on success
//
// Example:
//
//	// Secure config file (owner read/write only)
//	err := utils.WriteFileAtomic("config.json", data, 0o600)
//
//	// Public readable file
//	err := utils.WriteFileAtomic("public.txt", data, 0o644)
