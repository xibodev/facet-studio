// This is the property that makes pkg/agent independently consumable, and it is
// checked mechanically because it is invisible by reading: the offending import
// was ONE LINE in one file, and it dragged in six Layer-2/3 packages
// transitively -- the module host, subprocess execution, both wire protocols,
// the contract gate, and the cockpit's artefact view vocabulary.
//
// It is also disqualifying in a way that no amount of care prevents: internal/
// packages CANNOT be imported by an external module, so a sibling embedding the
// kernel would fail to compile with an error pointing at THIS repo. The failure
// would surface in their build, not ours.
//
// A comment saying "keep this clean" would not have caught it, because the
// import was added by someone wiring a feature, not by someone weakening a
// boundary.
