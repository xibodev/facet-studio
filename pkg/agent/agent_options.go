// ToolProvider contributes tools to an agent from outside the kernel.
//
// THIS IS THE KERNEL'S ONLY DOOR FOR NON-GENERIC CAPABILITIES, and it exists so
// the kernel can stay Layer 1.
//
// The kernel previously imported internal/moduletools directly and called it
// from registerSharedTools. That was a Layer 1 -> Layer 2 inversion,
// disqualifying twice over: architecturally a standalone product embedding the
// kernel dragged in module discovery, the v2 contract gate and bounded
// subprocess execution it would never use; and mechanically internal/ packages
// CANNOT BE IMPORTED by an external module, so any sibling embedding the kernel
// would simply fail to compile.
//
// That one import pulled in six Layer-2/3 packages transitively -- the module
// host, subprocess execution, both wire protocols, the contract gate, and the
// cockpit's artefact view vocabulary. Removing it drops all six at once; the
// audit found the other 55 of 56 transitive packages already generic.
//
// WHAT CROSSES THE BOUNDARY IS DELIBERATELY PLAIN. Tools arrive as
// tools.Tool, a four-method interface; the descriptive lines are []string; the
// knowledge loader is a plain func. No provider type reaches the agent struct,
// which is what makes the kernel independently consumable rather than merely
// separately compiled.
//
// Three shapes this serves:
//
//	full Studio  -- supplies a provider backed by the detached-module host
//	standalone   -- supplies a NATIVE, in-process provider binding its own
//	                capabilities, paying no subprocess or protocol cost to
//	                host itself
//	bare kernel  -- supplies none, and is a plain conversational runtime
type ToolProvider interface {
	// RegisterTools contributes tools via register and returns one-line
	// summaries for the agent's context.
	//
	// workspace is the AGENT'S OWN working directory, and it is passed rather
	// than captured because it is resolved PER AGENT inside the registration
	// loop -- the composition root does not know it. An earlier version of this
	// interface omitted it, which only surfaced when wiring the call sites:
	// the provider would have had to invent a workspace, and every agent would
	// have shared one.
	//
	// The returned knowledge function is optional -- nil is valid, and means
	// this provider has no per-selection knowledge to load. It maps a
	// provider-defined identifier to overlays, skills and warnings.

// Called once per agent during shared-tool registration, in the order given.
// Summaries accumulate across providers; the LAST non-nil knowledge loader
// wins, because a single selection resolves to a single provider today and
// silently merging two loaders would make an ambiguous selection look decided.
//
// Passing none is fully supported and is the standalone-kernel case.
