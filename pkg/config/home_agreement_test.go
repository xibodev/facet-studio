// The CLI and the host must resolve the SAME state root, or a module installed
// by one is invisible to the other.
//
// THE BUG THIS PINS, found by running rather than reading. There were two
// fallback implementations -- the CLI anchored to the executable's `.local`,
// the host to `~/.facet-studio` -- and they agreed ONLY when FACET_STUDIO_HOME
// was set. Unset, `modules-add` installed where the browser agent never looked:
// the CLI listed the module happily and the agent found zero.
//
// It failed SILENTLY, because discovery finding no modules is indistinguishable
// from none being installed. And it survived a week of development because
// every launch set the variable explicitly, which masks the divergence
// completely.
//
// This project has consolidated this class twice before -- once for module
// discovery, once for grants. Both unified the FUNCTION and left the `home`
// argument fed into it as two implementations. Same bug, one level up.
