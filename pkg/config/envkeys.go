// WHY THIS COMMENT EXISTS. There was a second implementation in the CLI with a
// DIFFERENT fallback, and the two only agreed when FACET_STUDIO_HOME was set.
// Unset, the CLI installed modules into an executable-anchored `.local` while
// the agent discovered from `~/.facet-studio` -- so `modules-add` succeeded, the
// CLI listed the module, and THE BROWSER AGENT SAW NOTHING. Discovery finding
// no modules is indistinguishable from none being installed, so it failed
// silently.
//
// It went unnoticed because every launch during development set the variable
// explicitly, which masks the divergence completely.
//
// This project has consolidated this exact class twice before -- once for
// module discovery and once for grants, both recorded in cmd/facet-studio.
// Those unified the FUNCTIONS and left the `home` argument fed into them as two
// implementations. Same bug, one level up.

// directory is a dev build, anything else is an install. That is the same
// signal DevHome already used to anchor itself, named once rather than

// an existing install's state. This one answers a narrower question -- "am I a
// dev build, and if so where is my sandbox" -- and callers that want the
